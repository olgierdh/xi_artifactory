-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.5) Defect Tracking Database
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiler defect reports can be tracked at the Development Tools bug
database, SDOWP. The log in page for SDOWP, as well as a link to create
an account with the defect tracking database is found at:

https://cqweb.ext.ti.com/pages/SDO-Web.html

A my.ti.com account is required to access this page.  To find an issue
in SDOWP, enter your bug id in the "Find Record ID" box once logged in.
To find tables of all compiler issues click the queries under the folder:

"Public Queries" -> "Development Tools" -> "TI C-C++ Compiler"

With your SDOWP account you can save your own queries in your
"Personal Queries" folder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.6) Long Term Support release
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ARM CGT v15.12.0.LTS release is a long term support (LTS) release. This
release will be supported for roughly 2 years with periodic bug fix updates.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  DWARF 4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release introduces the option to use the DWARF 4 Debugging Format.
DWARF 3 is still enabled by default, but DWARF 4 may be enabled by using
--symdebug:dwarf_version=4.  The RTS still uses DWARF 3.  DWARF versions 2, 3,
and 4 may be intermixed safely.

When DWARF 4 is enabled, type information will be placed in the new
.debug_types section.  At link time, duplicate type information will be
removed.  This method of type merging is superior to those used in DWARF 2 or 3
and will result in a smaller executable.  In addition, the size of intermediate
object files will be reduced in comparison to DWARF 3.

For more information, see:
http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/DWARF_4

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Aggregate data in subsections
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The compiler will now place all aggregate data (arrays, structs, and unions)
into subsections. This gives the linker more granularity for removing unused
data during the final link step. The behavior can be controlled using the
--gen_data_subsections=on,off option. The default is on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  GCC common symbol bug workaround
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a bug in the GNU linker (Bugzilla 18614) where common symbols that
are STB_LOCAL are not handled correctly. The GNU linker fails to allocate
space for them. To work around this bug, the TI tools will no longer use
common for unitialized local symbols. This should have very little impact
on the final executable.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. COFF ABI no longer supported
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of version 15.6.0.STS of the ARM CGT, COFF ABI support is discontinued.
If COFF ABI support is needed for your application, please use ARM CGT
version 5.2.x.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. RAM Function Support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ramfunc attribute can be used to specify that a function will be placed in
and executed out of RAM. This allows the compiler to optimize functions for
RAM execution, as well as to automatically copy functions to RAM on flash-based
devices.

The attribute is applied to a function with GCC attribute syntax, as follows:
   __attribute__((ramfunc))
   void f(void) { ... }

The --ramfunc=on option can be used to indicate that the attribute should be
applied to all functions in a translations unit, eliminating the need for
source code modification.

For more information, see:
http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Ramfunc_Attribute

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Generate REV, REVSH, REV16 instructions from native C
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The _rev, _revsh, and _rev16 intrinsic functions have always been available to
use these instructions. However, it is possible for the compiler to generate
them from native C expressions. This is ideal for customers who wish to write
source code that is portable across ISAs and tool chains. The instructions
can now be generated based on the following source code sequences:

REV:
(((word << 24U) & 0xFF000000U) |
 ((word << 8U)  & 0x00FF0000U) |
 ((word >> 8U)  & 0x0000FF00U) |
 ((word >> 24U) & 0x000000FFU))

REV16:
((word >> 8) & 0x00FF00FF) | ((word << 8) & 0xFF00FF00)

REVSH:
((word << 24) >> 16) | ((word >> 8) & 0xFF)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) Module summary in linker map file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The linker map file now contains a module summary view. This view organizes
the object files by directory or library and displays the code, read-write, and
read-only size that the file contributed to the resulting executable.

Sample output:

MODULE SUMMARY

       Module                     code    ro data   rw data
       ------                     ----    -------   -------
    .\Application\
       file1.obj                  1146    0         920    
       file2.obj                  316     0         0      
    +--+--------------------------+-------+---------+---------+
       Total:                     1462    0         920

    +--+--------------------------+-------+---------+---------+
       Grand Total:               2664    204       1964

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) New compiler versioning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiler versioning will now include both long term and short term releases.
  year.month.patch.[LTS|STS]

Long term releases:  This is the release same model currently supported today
with periodic patch releases for approximately 2 years.

Short term releases:  Between LTS releases there will be additional short
term releases that will be supported only until the next STS or LTS release.
These releases will be available through the Code Composer Studio Apps Center
in future CCS releases.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) STLport C++ RTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v15.3.0 introduces the STLport C++03 RTS. The move to STLport will break ABI
compatibility with previous C++ RTS releases. Attempting to link old C++
object code with the new RTS will result in a link-time error. Suppressing
this error will likely result in undefined symbols or undefined behavior during
execution. Breakages are known to occur in particular for object code using
locale, iostream, and string.

In most cases, recompiling old source code with the new RTS should be safe.
However, for non-standard API extensions to the C++ library, compatibility is
not guaranteed. This includes usage of hash_map, slist, and rope.

Dependence between locale and iostream is increased in STLport. Usage of one
will likely cause the other to be linked as well. This may cause an additive
increase in both code size and initialization time.

C ABI compatibility will not be affected by this change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) Aliased Memory Ranges
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some devices have a region of RAM that can be addressed by two different memory buses (a system bus and an instruction bus).

In order to use above capability, the linker must be aware of the two memory ranges.  Use below syntax for ALIAS memory ranges.  ALIAS regions must have the same length.


MEMORY
{
    ...
    ALIAS
    {
      SRAM_CODE (RWX) : origin = 0x01000000
      SRAM_DATA (RW)  : origin = 0x20000000
    } length = 0x0001000
    ...
}
